Question 1 : Write a Java method to compute the average of three numbers.

Question 2 : Write a method named isEven that accepts an int argument. The method
should return true if the argument is even, or false otherwise. Also write a program to test your
method.

Question 3 :Write a Java program to check if a number is a palindrome in Java? ( 121 is a
palindrome, 321 is not)
A number is called a palindrome if the number is equal to the reverse of a number e.g., 121 is a
palindrome because the reverse of 121 is 121 itself. On the other hand, 321 is not a
palindrome because the reverse of 321 is 123, which is not equal to 321.
