Question 1: Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the
array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Question 2: Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
